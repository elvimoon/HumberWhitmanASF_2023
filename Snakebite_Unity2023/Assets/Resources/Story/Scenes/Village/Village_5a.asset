  - text: (I decide to drop by our neighbor's house before heading to the farm to
      check if Aye is there and to say hello.)
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 911c0d51321b7ba4b99f03f6a3d61a25, type: 2}
  - text: (I see Aye chatting with the neighbor by the front door, and I approach
      the pair.)
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 911c0d51321b7ba4b99f03f6a3d61a25, type: 2}
  - text: There you are, Aye. I hope you weren't troubling our neighbor this morning.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 911c0d51321b7ba4b99f03f6a3d61a25, type: 2}
  - text: Good morning, Sir. I hope you're doing well. How's your hand been treating
      you?
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 911c0d51321b7ba4b99f03f6a3d61a25, type: 2}
  - text: Of course not, I haven't caused any trouble at all. Isn't that right Sir?
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: cfab85cd0782ca949a1254c2e086c717, type: 2}
  - text: Haha that's right, little Aye has just been checking to see how I'm doing.
      A good morning to you too, Adama.

  - text: (Our neighbor is someone I've interacted with all my life. Two decades
      older than I, he unfortunately suffered a snakebite injury on his hand last
      year, and though treated through great expense, it left him with permanent
      injuries that continues to pain him to this day.)
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 911c0d51321b7ba4b99f03f6a3d61a25, type: 2}
  - text: (He stays at home nowadays, helping out around the house doing his best
      not to inconvenience the rest of his family. I'm sure it must have been tough
      for him; his family faced near bankruptcy by exchanging a majority of their
      livestock to afford the snakebite antivenom and treatment.)
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 911c0d51321b7ba4b99f03f6a3d61a25, type: 2}
  - text: (I'm sure he must have felt great shame and guilt, but I wish him all the
      best. He always treated me and my family warmly.)
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 911c0d51321b7ba4b99f03f6a3d61a25, type: 2}
  - text: That's good to hear, Sir. Everyone was worried and shocked when they learned
      of your situation.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 911c0d51321b7ba4b99f03f6a3d61a25, type: 2}
  - text: Yes, well, that's life I suppose. Snakes bite people, and people die. I
      suppose I can count myself lucky for still being alive.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8669be0c372de4144a9b863ed6a60f86, type: 2}
  - text: Just a word of advice, always be cautious when you're out and about, you
      hear? Snakes can easily blend in with their surroundings. I would hate for
      anything to happen to you and your family.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 8669be0c372de4144a9b863ed6a60f86, type: 2}
  - text: Thank you, Sir. I'll remember your advice. I must be heading off to the
      farm now, have a good day. Aye, be a good child, I'll see you later.
