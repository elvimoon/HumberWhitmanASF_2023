  - text: tsk, calm yourself Adama. Cuts and broken bones, I can easily help, but
      snakebites are different. I can clean and bandage the wound, but I have no
      effective treatment for the venom.

      expensive, almost an entire month's worth of our family's earnings. This also
      doesn't include the cost of rehabilitation afterwards.
